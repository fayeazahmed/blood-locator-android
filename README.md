"# blood-locator-android" 

I built this project in order to learn basics of android studio. Blood Locator is an app where we can search for blood donors filtered by blood group on the map (powered by <i>Mapbox</i>), then look up contact details. I took this idea from one of the first personal projects I made, the web app of same name. The donor records can be added by the user themselves.\n
I tried to use the same mongo database attached to the web app at first, but had a hard time doing it in a efficient way. So I just created a firebase application and used that as the back-end and/or database to this project. Learned a lot about android apps and making of them through building this small project.
